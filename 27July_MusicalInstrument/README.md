# Musical Instrument

**Description**

To use the musical instrument, press the 4 buttons to play different notes and use the potentiometer to control the speed of the servo motor for the beat.

**Solutions**

I utilized various techniques in order to make the musical instrument less clutterred and easier to play for the user. One of the main things I focused on was wire management. I cut a red wire into 4 smaller wires and stripped their ends so that I would not have to used 4 large red wires for the buttons. I also braided the analog input wires together so They wouldn't overlap each other and cause problems for the user. This was a technique I used for wire management for multiple wires connecting to adjacent ports in my high school robotics team.

**Problems**

I had originally tried to attach an item to the end of the servo, but I realized that when the item contacted the surface, the sound was very minor. So I removed it and used the bare servo horns. Additionally, I also had a lot of difficulty stripping the wires because I do not have wire strippers at home. Thus, I resorted to scissors and experienced several failures before finally stripping the wires succesfully.
