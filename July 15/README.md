I made a single player pong variation game. The player must use a paddle to hit the ball before the ball goes off screen. As the game progresses the speed of the ball increases and it becomes increasingly challenging. The color of the ball changes as a visual indication of the increased difficulty.

I utilized a ball class in order to create and update the ball and created other void methods to check the ball collision with the paddle. I also used PFont to illustrate the score and update it.
