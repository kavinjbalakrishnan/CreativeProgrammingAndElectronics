# Single Player Pong

**Description**

I made a single player variation of pong. The player uses a paddle to hit the ball before it leaves the screen. As the game progresses the speed of the ball increases and it becomes increasingly challenging. The color of the ball also changes as a visual indication of the increased difficulty.

I utilized a ball class in order to create and update the ball and other void methods to check the ball collision with the paddle. I also used PFont to display the score and update it.
