Here is a screenshot of my self portrait
![](selfPortrait.jpg)

The environment that I choose to illustrate in the background is the park. 
I chose the park because I spend a lot of time there and it is my hangout spot.
During this lockdown, I have been going to the park everyday to relax or to spend time with my friends.

One of the difficulties I had was ensuring that all the shapes in my self portrait were alligned properly.
I would estimate the parameters, test the resulting shape, and adjust them if needed.
In hindsight, I realize that had I used variables it might have been easier to ensure all the shapes were alligned with each other.
