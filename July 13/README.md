**Inspiration**

My inspiration for this project was a city skyline. I wanted to create something that resembled a timelapse of a city's skyline. I also remember watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjXbxG8YRKw) on youtube about a man who was shooting a 30 year timelapse of New York city. I thought that was realy interesting and I found it fascinating how much a city can change in a span of just 24 hours. 

**Artwork Rules**

I wanted my artwork to be scalable - to function and scale regardless of the canvas size. To achieve this I had to make all my variables in terms of the width and height of the canvas. Additionally, I wanted all of the windows to be uniform and spaced out evenly for each building. To change the artwork from night to day, the user simply needs to click the mouse.

**Interesting Discoveries**
I used a nested for loop in order to create the windows and ensure that they were all spaced evenly. I also used Perlin noise in order to create a glowing effect for the sun and the stars. This created a really cool flickering effect that enhanced the artwork. I had many lines of code in my draw() function prompting me to break it up into multiple helper functions, enhancing the readability of draw(). I also used variable names that were easy to understand which reduced the overall number of comments.
