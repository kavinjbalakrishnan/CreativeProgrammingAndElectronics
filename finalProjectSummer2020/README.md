# Final Project
## Description
For my final project I decided to build upon my pong game. My initial pong game was single player and involved using keyboard inputs to control the paddle. For the final, I succesfully created a multiplayer implementation that can be played by 2 people. Additionally, instead of using keyboard inputs to control the paddles, I utilized serial communication between the arduino and Processing. Consequently, the paddles can be controlled by buttons connected to the Arduino.
